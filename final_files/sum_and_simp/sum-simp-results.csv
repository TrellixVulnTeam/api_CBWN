With the advent of British annexation on territories, farmers were forced to grow only cash crops such as indigo, opium and cotton at the cost of food grains. The company bought crops at the lowest possible rate, which meant the farmer made almost no profit. Then the farmers had to buy food grain as they no longer grew it; food grain and vegetables were expensive as they were scarce as not many farmers grew them anymore. This led to starvation deaths and famines. In addition to high expenses and scarcity of food grain, farmers had to pay high taxes to the British which was extracted by the oppressive zamindars, Crops like indigo reduced the quality of the soil and made it unfit for farming food crops.

9,"Dictatorship or Fascism became an emergent form of government in the early part of the 20th century in Europe. While there were many complex reasons for this, one of the obvious reasons was that Europe was grappling with the concept of democracy. After the First World War, many new nations came into existence. These nations were created by the break up of raperial F empires. Unfortunately, these new states had no clear political legacy as centuries of imperial rule meant that they had no political experience or class of their own other than revolutionaries. So they tried to adopt democracy but occasionally failed. Since the power of politics and its use was still beyond the understanding of most people as they lacked political experience, the few who mastered it bypassed the democratic process for their benefit. ‘ This gave rise to dictatorships all over Europe, most important of which were in Italy and Germany. While dictatorships brought a semblance of political stability to the new state, they were disastrous for the overall political environment of Europe. Dictatorships were based on the attitude that military might is power and power is right.
