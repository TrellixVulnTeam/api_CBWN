The American President, Woodrow Wilson had asked Americans to be ‘impartial in thought as well as in action’.

At the end of the war all the nations met in Paris and Versailles to discuss the future of Europe. The defeated nations were not allowed to participate, nor were their ideas considered.

Germany and her allies were held responsible for the aggression, so it was forced to cede part of her pre-war territories to Poland, Belgium, The signing of Treaty of Versailles Denmark and Czechoslovakia.

2,"Italy had been on the victorious side of the war yet other than getting the Italian-speaking regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire it had not won any concessions, unlike France which got the German coal fields. Italy was denied many of the colonies and provinces that she had expected. This had been a big disappointment as it hindered Italy’s vision of being recognised as a great European power.

Economic Stress

The First World War had left Italy a completely depleted nation. The war had not just caused loss of human life but also damaged the entire fabric of society as a large part of the work force was killed during the war. The long war years meant that for an agriculture-based country, there was lack of produce and food shortages. After the war, things did not improve. Instead there was a very high unemployment rate as there had been no industrial or agricultural growth during the war years. The country was beset with severe inflation. Poverty seemed to eat into the depleted social structure. People wanted a government that could solve these problems.

Political Instability

With Italy going through so much economic turmoil, it needed a Wha t's More strong political leadership to give the country a much needed morale boost and a clear direction. The political parties in Italy were more turned into a dictator interested in improving their personal positions with very little and adhered to Fascist","Italy had been on the victorious side of the war yet other than getting the Italian-speaking regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire it had not won any concessions, unlike France which got the German coal fields.

After the First World War, Italy had very little money.
