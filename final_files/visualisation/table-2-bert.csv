It decides on the procedures that have to be adopted and the methods to make the system efficient and effective for all.","The High Court, like the Supreme Court has the responsibility of protecting the Constitution of India. Therefore, it has the right to declare any law or executive order of the state null and void, if it finds that it contradicts or goes against the spirit of Constitution."
1,All decisions and decrees of the Supreme Court are kept as records for future reference. Important decisions in landmark cases of the High Court are also kept as records to raise as points of reference in other cases. One of the important reasons why the Supreme Court is called the ‘Custodian of the Constitution is that it has the power to examine the validity of the laws made by the Union and State Legislatures.,"The 42°* amendment to the Constitution had restricted this authority of the High Court during emergency, but with the repeal of certain sections of the amendment, the powers have been reinstated. It protects the rights of each citizen of the country and sees to it that these rights are not eroded or diluted through misinterpretation or infringement. It does so by issuing writs to the offending parties. The High Courts are there to provide advice to all government agencies and the Governor to resolve problems that they might face regarding constitutional matters. The High Court is responsible for the administration of all courts in the state within its jurisdiction and itself. It has to a see that justice is available to all."
