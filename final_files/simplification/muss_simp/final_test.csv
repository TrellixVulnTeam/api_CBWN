Unfortunately, these new states had no clear political legacy. They had been ruled by the same people for a long time, so they did not have any political experience.

Because most people did not know how to use politics, and because they did not have political experience, the few people who knew how to use politics did not use the democratic process.
This gave rise to dictatorships all over Europe. The two most important countries were Italy and Germany.
While dictatorships brought some political stability to the new country, Europe as a whole did not appreciate them very much.
Dictatorships were based on the idea that power was always given to the military.
