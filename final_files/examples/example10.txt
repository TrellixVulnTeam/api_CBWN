Dictatorship or Fascism became an emergent form of government in the early part of the 20th century in Europe. While there were many complex reasons for this, one of the obvious reasons was that Europe was grappling with the concept of democracy.After the First World War, many new nations came into existence. These nations were created by the break up of raperial F empires. Unfortunately, these new states had no clear political legacy as centuries of imperial rule meant that they had no political experience or class of their own other than revolutionaries. So they tried to adopt democracy but occasionally failed. Since the power of politics and its use was still beyond the understanding of most people as they lacked political experience, the few who mastered it bypassed the democratic process for their benefit. â€˜This gave rise to dictatorships all over Europe, most important of which were in Italy and Germany. While dictatorships brought a semblance of political stability to the new state, they were disastrous for the overall political environment of Europe. Dictatorships were based on the attitude that military might is power and power is right. As nations, they became belligerent and aggressive.
