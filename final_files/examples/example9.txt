It was not merely a revolt by the British army personnels or rulers of particular regions; it was a massive war which witnessed participation of kings, queens, landlords, peasants, tribals and soldiers alike. While the war actually took place in 1857, the ground for the battlefield was prepared over a course of hundred years. The British, who had initially arrived as traders, gradually embarked on a dual mission of conquest and profit in India. The victory of British troops over Bengal in the Battle of Lord Clive and Mir Zafar Plassey in 1757 was an inception of British rule in India. a With this, British moved on to becoming the rulers of the lands of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa {now Odisha) and the whole of India after 1857. Even though the revolt broke out in 1857, the undercurrents had been felt much earlier. The pursuit of exploitative political and economic policies by the British was largely resented by the diverse sections of the Indian society. All it needed was the proverbial trigger to be pulled, which eventually happened with the hanging of a young sepoy Mangal Pandey.But before you delve into the chronicle of the revolt that eventually turned into a war, it is important to understand the main causes of revolt of 1857.
