The basic structure of the Supreme Court is patterned on the structure of the Federal Court of India that was set up by the British under the Government of India Act, 1935. It is the highest court of appeal in India. The Supreme Court of India is headed by the Chief Justice of India. He/she has a bench of judges who work with him/her. The Supreme Court consists of the Chief Justice and 25 judges. However, the number of judges may change, and this is fixed by the Parliament. The President of India appoints the Chief Justice after consulting with the judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justices of the High Courts. The other judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.
