The total strength of the Rajya Sabha cannot be more than 250 of which 238 are elected while 12 arc nominated by the President of India. Election to the Rajya Sabha is done indirectly. The members of the state legislature elect the state representatives to the Rajya Sabha in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. The seats in the Rajya Sabha for each state and Union Territory arc fixed on the basis of its population. A constituency is an area demarcated for the purpose of election. In other words, it is an area or locality with a certain number of people who choose a person to represent them in the Lok Sabha. Each State and Union Territory is divided into territorial constituencies.The division is not based on area but on population. Let us consider Mizoram, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
