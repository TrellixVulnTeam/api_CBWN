The Supreme Court as the apex court of India has the responsibility to see the smooth functioning of the entire judicial system, so it looks after the administration of all courts of the country and regulates their functioning. It decides on the procedures that have to be adopted and the methods to make the system efficient and effective for all.

All decisions and decrees of the Supreme Court are kept as records for future reference. Important decisions in landmark cases of the High Court are also kept as records to raise as points of reference in other cases.

One of the important reasons why the Supreme Court is called the â€˜Custodian of the Constitution is that it has the power to examine the validity of the laws made by the Union and State Legislatures. In case, any law violates the spirit of the Constitution, the Supreme Court can declare it null and void.
