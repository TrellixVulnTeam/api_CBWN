Justice is not the prerogative of the rich and powerful. Every Indian has the right to seek judicial redressal for injustice done to him/her, whether it is loss of revenue or destruction of environment. He/she can demand to be heard and compensated for his/her loss because the framers of our Constitution, themselves having suffered the ignominy of unfair practices under the British, ensured in the Constitution that Modern India would have an independent judiciary, so that all citizens would feel free to approach the judicial system and settle their disputes lawfully. The Indian judiciary is fully integrated starting with the Apex Court at the top going down to the lowest courts in the districts. The structure of the Indian judicial system is elaborate. It covers major conflict areas such as disputes between two states and goes right down to the level of Lok Adalats that settle the simplest civil disputes at the village level.
