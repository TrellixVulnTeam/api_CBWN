India was still an agrarian economy and a majority of its population resided in villages. With the advent of British annexation on territories, farmers were forced to grow only cash crops such as indigo, opium and cotton at the cost of food grains. The company bought crops at the lowest possible rate, which meant the farmer made almost no profit. Then the farmers had to buy food grain as they no longer grew it; food grain and vegetables were expensive as they were scarce as not many farmers grew them anymore. This led to starvation deaths and famines. In addition to high expenses and scarcity of food grain, farmers had to pay high taxes to the British which was extracted by the oppressive zamindars, Crops like indigo reduced the quality of the soil and made it unfit for farming food crops. The companyâ€™s mishandling of the peasantry clearly shows that the company put short-term profits for themselves over long-term concern for the Indian people.
