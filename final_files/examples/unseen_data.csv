0,"When the War broke out in Europe, the USA had decided to remain neutral as it felt it was a European war which had nothing to do with it. The American President, Woodrow Wilson had asked Americans to be ‘impartial in thought as well as in action’. But Germany in an attempt to break the British power decided to use its navy to isolate Britain. The German submarines began to attack all merchant ships that crossed the Atlantic. In early 1917, the German U-boats sank the Lusitania which had a number of Americans on board. USA broke-off diplomatic relations with Germany, and when it intercepted a message from Germany urging Mexico to join the war and reclaim land that it had lost to America, it decided to declare war on Germany. These events changed the outcome of the war. Fresh enthusiastic American troops helped boost the morale of the Allies and push the war in their favour. The ‘Great War’, which began on July 28, 1914 and ended with the German armistice of November 11, 1918, had resulted in a vast number of casualties and deaths and similarly vast numbers of missing soldiers. The precise numbers remain shrouded in the passage of time compounded by the incompleteness of available records.",,,,
1,"The First World War was brought to an end with the signing of treaties between the victorious and defeated nations. At the end of the war all the nations met in Paris and Versailles to discuss the future of Europe. The defeated nations were not allowed to participate, nor were their ideas considered. Around 27 countries attended the conferences but it is the leaders of the three major powers—Llyod George from England, Georges Clemencau from France and President Woodrow Wilson of the USA who took all the decisions. Germany was forced to sign the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919. This treaty was very unfair and very harsh but Germany had no option but to sign it. Some terms of the treaty:
Germany and her allies were held responsible for the aggression, so it was forced to cede part of her pre-war territories to Poland, Belgium, The signing of Treaty of Versailles Denmark and Czechoslovakia.
Alsace and Lorraine were returned to France, while the mineral rich Saar valley was ceded to France for 15 years. Denmark got back the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.
 Germany had to give up all her colonies in Africa and Asia to the victorious nations, primarily to England and France.
The Rhine Valley was declared a demilitarised zone. A small navy was permitted but Germany was not allowed to have any Air Force or submarines and her standing army
could not exceed 1,00,000.",,,,
2,"Italy had been on the victorious side of the war yet other than getting the Italian-speaking regions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire it had not won any concessions, unlike France which got the German coal fields. Italy was denied many of the colonies and provinces that she had expected. This had been a big disappointment as it hindered Italy’s vision of being recognised as a great European power.

Economic Stress

The First World War had left Italy a completely depleted nation. The war had not just caused loss of human life but also damaged the entire fabric of society as a large part of the work force was killed during the war. The long war years meant that for an agriculture-based country, there was lack of produce and food shortages. After the war, things did not improve. Instead there was a very high unemployment rate as there had been no industrial or agricultural growth during the war years. The country was beset with severe inflation. Poverty seemed to eat into the depleted social structure. People wanted a government that could solve these problems.

Political Instability

With Italy going through so much economic turmoil, it needed a Wha t's More strong political leadership to give the country a much needed morale boost and a clear direction. The political parties in Italy were more turned into a dictator interested in improving their personal positions with very little and adhered to Fascist",,,,
